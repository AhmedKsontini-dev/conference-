This project is a conference management web application developed using Symfony and MySQL. 
The platform allows organizers to create and manage events, including setting a maximum number of participants for each conference. 
Users must be authenticated in order to participate in an event by providing their first name, last name, and email address. 
To ensure reliable registration management, each email address can be used only once per event, and registrations are automatically closed when the maximum number of participants is reached. This system provides an efficient, secure, and well-structured solution for managing conferences.
